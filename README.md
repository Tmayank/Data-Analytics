# Data-Analytics
In this project we were given a raw data of absenteeism of the company using certain factors.
STEPS we will do :
Preprocessing and Cleaning the data using Python and calling it "ABsenteeisn_new_data".
Then make a model (Machine learning) of Logistic Regression saved as "Model", so that we could directly call methods.
Then the data of predicted is saved as a csv file through untergrating Sql with pyhton.
Finally The predicted outuput table is visualised in Tableau.
